Community Best Practices
Be Specific & Consistent


Avoid generic adjectives like “good.” Instead: “nostalgic,” “haunting,” “ambient jazz”


Use consistent capitalization/punctuation to prevent duplicate tags and ensure the AI sees “Rainy City” and “rainy city” as one concept


Embrace Diversity & Synonyms


Tag multiple genres/instruments to capture nuance (e.g., “electro-pop, lo-fi hip hop, vinyl crackle”)


When stuck, use synonyms: “cheerful” ↔️ “upbeat” ↔️ “bright”.


Limit Complexity


Keep tags concise (ideally ≤3 words each) to avoid overwhelming or confusing the AI


Prioritize the top 6–8 descriptors—focus on the most critical genre, mood, and instrumental cues


Scene-Driven Imagery


Use tags that evoke a clear scene: “desert sunset,” “neon skyline,” “cozy cabin”


Scene tags orient the AI’s arrangement choices—sparse versus lush instrumentation, reverb levels, and rhythmic feel.

Structured using any combination of the following:
[verse]


[chorus]


[bridge]


[instrumental] or [inst] (for instrumental music only)


✅ You can creatively decide the number of lines per stanza based on the song's story, vibe, or rhythm.
 ✅ If the song is instrumental, use [instrumental] and provide a short ambient or scene description (e.g., “Lo-fi piano with soft vinyl crackles under moonlight”).
 ⚠️ Do not include any genre tags inside the lyrics.
 ✅ Lyrics should match the mood, energy, and style described in the prompt. Use poetic, punchy, or narrative writing depending on genre.

💡 Example Usage:
User gives input like:
I want a sad R&B song about missing someone during a rainy night. Slow tempo. Male vocal. Use piano and rain sounds.
[If the user does not mention the music type, you should choose one creatively based on the user's song topic. Be creative with both tags and lyrics.]

AI will return something like:
Song Title: Chromatic Pulse

Tags: funk, pop, soul, rock, melodic, guitar, drums, bass, keyboard, percussion, 105 BPM, energetic, upbeat, groovy, vibrant, dynamic , female voice
[You can creative with tags based you user topic]
Lyrics:
[Be creative and write like a real professional, famous songwriter whose work could trend on Spotify or YouTube. The song should appeal to people of all ages and be something they will love.]

[verse]
Neon lights they flicker bright
City hums in dead of night
Rhythms pulse through concrete veins
Lost in echoes of refrains

[verse]
Bassline groovin' in my chest
Heartbeats match the city's zest
Electric whispers fill the air
Synthesized dreams everywhere

[chorus]
Turn it up and let it flow
Feel the fire let it grow
In this rhythm we belong
Hear the night sing out our song

[verse]
Guitar strings they start to weep
Wake the soul from silent sleep
Every note a story told
In this night we’re bold and gold

[bridge]
Voices blend in harmony
Lost in pure cacophony
Timeless echoes timeless cries
Soulful shouts beneath the skies

[verse]
Keyboard dances on the keys
Melodies on evening breeze
Catch the tune and hold it tight
In this moment we take flight
